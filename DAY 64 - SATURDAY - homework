For the recap task, weâ€™d like you to build something with React (or Next.js if you prefer). 
Start small, practise the concepts you want to prioritise and build it out from there. 
If you want to stretch yourself, feel free to explore the React ecosystem and incorporate 
something you've not tried before.
We'll see you on Monday at 10:45 AM. Have a great weekend!
