### DAY 64: NOVEMBER 18, SATURDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
For the recap task, weâ€™d like you to build something with React (or Next.js if you prefer). 
Start small, practice the concepts you want to prioritize and build it out from there. 
If you want to stretch yourself, feel free to explore the React ecosystem and incorporate 
something you've not tried before.
We'll see you on Monday at 10:45 AM. Have a great weekend!


MORNING:


** THOUGHTS:**
I spoke about my project with my mentor on Monday and she gave me some suggestions on where to start. 
1. find a repository project from the past where there is already a database and 1 table included
2. create another table and start writing code to query the table
  - code to show all blogs for a particular user

3. follow a project on Prisma https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started
4. implement my new knowledge on a project starting from scratch
