** Today's PROGRESS**:

AFTERNOON:


** THOUGHTS:**

** LINK TO WORK:

One of my boot camper colleagues created this:
I've made this deck of flashcards to help with cementing the Express.js knowledge - I hope it can be helpful. 
It's also available on Anki, which is great spaced repetition software to get extra studying in when doing other things 
(especially if you download the iOS app, but they also have desktop software) - there's a link in the repo. 
I've double-checked everything, so hopefully, there aren't errors, however, if there's anything you feel needs to be 
changed or if you would like to add anything, please feel free to submit a pull request. I will be updating the repo and 
Anki deck next week with more for our SQL content (unfortunately Anki doesn't automatically update decks, so it has to be manually 
re-downloaded to get updates). Good luck to everyone for next week!
