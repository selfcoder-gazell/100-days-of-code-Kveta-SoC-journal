### DAY 18: SEPTEMBER 25, MONDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
MORNING:
In the morning we tackled a task in GitHub - to make a clock hand move around in regular intervals of 1 second (https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/bc15-w4-d1-workshop-clock-challenge-team29-w4)
Today we talked about Node.JS. 
It is a tool to build own API. 

The advantages of having its own API:
- we have no control over public API
- customization 
- cost efficiency
- performance
- security
- reliability
- long-term cost

Developing own API gives knowledge to a full-stack developer and it is crucial for future development. 

NODE.JS is an open-source cross-platform. 
OPEN SOURCE = free to use, share, and modify by anyone. 
JS is a runtime environment - a program that allows us to run J.S. code on our computers or servers. 
Event-driven programming. 

Java Script Engine - a program or SW that interprets and executes J.S. Code. 

** THOUGHTS:**


CODE EXAMPLES:
Code example from the session:
Remember, in order to import and export functionality using ESM (ECMAScript Modules), I had to generate a package.json file with this command:
npm init -y
And then, add the following to my package.json file:
"type": "module"
I then created the following files:
// math.js

export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}
// app.js

import {add, subtract} from "./math.js";

const sum = add(4, 5);

console.log(sum);
To run my app.js file, I entered the following command in the terminal:
node app.js
