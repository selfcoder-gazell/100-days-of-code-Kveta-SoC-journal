### DAY 21: SEPTEMBER 28, THURSDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today we got introduced to mind-blowing middleware functions. 
We created our own custom middleware function. We used third-party middleware functions. 


MORNING:

AFTERNOON:
Middleware functions have access to request Obj. and response Obj. as well as additional parameters. 
(req, res, next).
Introduction to custom middleware, and third-party middleware (express, morgan).

Some resources to look at:
Different ways to include information in the request: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2rQ88l0wvw

Designing REST APIs: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design
How to use Express.js: https://expressjs.com/
Useful JSON tool: https://github.com/omniti-labs/jsend
Identify what you’re getting and what you’re not getting. Then make a list of what you’re not 
getting and tackle them systematically.

Middleware explained in the Express docs: https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html

For those who want to create a separate frontend to practice using fetch and making requests to your API, 
you'll need to make use of this (third-party) middleware package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors

A couple of examples in the docs may use arrow functions instead of the standard functions we are used to.
