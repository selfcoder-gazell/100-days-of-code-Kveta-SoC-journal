### DAY 12: SEPTEMBER 25, MONDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:

Learning to solve problems first before doing any coding. 
Today we were given a task to collaboratively work on the CODEWARS workshop. 
Using our communication skills we needed to express our thoughts clearly.
Talking through what you think in coding. 

** THOUGHTS:**
Starting on an easier level in CODEWARS is a good idea.
