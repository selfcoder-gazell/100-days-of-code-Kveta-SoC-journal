Today, you'll be diving into a real-world-like tech test that will allow you to showcase the skills you've been developing.
You will have a choice among three different full-stack projects. Each one will test your abilities and encourage you to apply 
your knowledge to create something tangible and functional.
You're currently in groups of five or six, so you'll need to divide yourselves into pairs or trios. Decide amongst yourselves 
how you wish to team up, balancing the group's dynamics and ensuring everyone is on board with the chosen project.
Tech Test Choices:
Option 1: Note-Taking Application
Option 2: Personal Budget Manager
Option 3: Event Scheduler and Calendar
Consider your interests, strengths, and what skills you want to challenge when choosing. There's no right or wrong choice here - 
each option is a pathway to demonstrate your creativity and problem-solving prowess.

Full-Stack Tech Test (Note-Taking App)
Objective
Create a functional note-taking application that allows users to manage their notes with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Requirements
Users should be able to create, view, edit, and delete notes.
Notes should have a title and a content body.
Implement a database to persist note data.
Deploy/host your project on a publicly accessible URL so we can see it working
Technical Specifications
Front-End
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Back-End
RESTful API developed with Node.js.
Integrate a database (e.g. PostgreSQL).
Automated Tests
Include tests for your API endpoints.
Ensure core functionality is covered.
Development Rules
Work in pairs or trios, using the Driver-Navigator approach for coding. Make sure to switch roles regularly!
Make frequent, small commits to track and manage changes easily.
Plan before you code. Write pseudocode as comments in your code to act as a roadmap when you start to code. Break down each step and think through the logic.
Remember: The goal is to solve the problem before you start coding. Think of the actual code as simply translating your well-thought-out plan into syntax the computer understands. 
Working this way will make the development process more organised. Good software development is as much about planning and understanding as it is about writing the code.

Full-Stack Tech Test (Event Scheduler and Calendar)
Objective
Develop an application where users can schedule and manage events within a calendar interface.

Requirements
Add, view, edit, and delete events on a calendar.
Effective display of events on the calendar.
Conflict detection to prevent overlapping events.
