### DAY 31: OCTOBER 8, SATURDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today I was trying to understand the MVC (Model - View - Controller) architectural pattern. 
I have drawn a flow diagram to help me understand it. 
Still not sure if I do fully understand the principles behind it but I am definitely closer to understanding it than before.
