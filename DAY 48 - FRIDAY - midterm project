### DAY 46: OCTOBER 25, WEDNESDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today we did some more coding in the morning. Thanks to David we managed to exceed our goal and completed one stretch goal. 
The goal was to change the color of our revision objects to red when they were due to be revised. 

MORNING: 
We spent the morning preparing our presentation. 

AFTERNOON:
In the afternoon we were doing a presentation to our judges (our judges were a variety of potential employers from different companies - 
interested in hiring some of us in the future. 


RETROSPECTIVE: 
I thoroughly enjoyed working in a team - sharing the same goal. As a bonus achieving the same goal. 
Despite the fact that I felt that I was one of the weakest links when it came to technical 
knowledge and its application. 
Without David and Patryk we would not be able to achieve our MVP and beyond.
