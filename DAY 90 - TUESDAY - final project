### DAY 89, JANUARY 2, TUESDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:

Today we worked on our presentation for our pseudo-stakeholders. 
We use iMovie on Livi's Mac to create/edit our presentation. 
We all - recorded some video of our gardens or food in the fridge and used it as a part of our presentation. 

MORNING:
Everyone seems tired after a week off (Christmas and New Year period). It was a little harder to motivate ourselves after a long time off.

Product Development Guide (Bootcampers) | Built with Notion
Don’t forget what you learned about “Product” and “Design Thinking”. It would be best if you spent the time 
to deeply understand the problem(s) you’re solving.
You should take care to step through the “Design Thinking” steps below (under 
Discovery heading) and consider if any of them need revisiting as you move through the weeks.
