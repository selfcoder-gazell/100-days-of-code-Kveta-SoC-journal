** Today's PROGRESS**:
TODAY WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT A PRODUCT-LED COMPANY AND HOW TO RECOGNISE A GOOD PRODUCT TEAM. 

A product-led company is one that relies on its product as the primary driver of customer acquisition, retention, and expansion. Here are some signs that indicate a company is product-led:
User-Centric Design: The product is designed with a focus on user experience and usability. It is intuitive, user-friendly, and requires minimal training for users to get started.
Freemium or Free Tier: The company offers a free or freemium version of its product, allowing users to start using it without making an initial payment.
In-App Onboarding: The product has in-app onboarding that guides new users through its features and helps them quickly realize its value.
Self-Service Model: Users can sign up and start using the product without the need for direct sales involvement. The company offers self-service resources for support and troubleshooting.
Viral Features: The product includes features that encourage users to invite others, fostering organic growth. Viral loops and referral mechanisms are part of the product's design.
Data-Driven Improvements: The company actively collects user data and feedback to make continuous improvements to the product. This iterative approach is used to enhance the user experience and value.
Transparent Pricing: Pricing is transparent and easily accessible to users. Premium or paid features are clearly presented, and users can upgrade their accounts within the product.
In-Product Upselling: The company employs in-product prompts and feature limitations to upsell free users to premium or paid versions.
Online Communities and Support: There are online communities, forums, or knowledge bases where users can seek help, connect with other users, and share best practices.
Rapid User Adoption: The product experiences rapid user adoption and growth, often driven by word-of-mouth and user referrals.
Low Sales Involvement: Sales teams have a supporting role, if any, and do not play a primary role in customer acquisition. Sales involvement is more common in enterprise or non-product-led models.
Frequent Product Updates: The product is regularly updated with new features and improvements based on user needs and feedback.
Customer Success Teams: While customer success teams may exist, they focus on helping users maximize the value they get from the product rather than driving initial sales.
Focus on User Metrics: The company measures its success using user-centric metrics, such as user engagement, retention, and Net Promoter Score (NPS).
Low Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): The CAC is relatively low because customers discover and adopt the product without the need for expensive sales and marketing efforts.
Scalable Growth: The company's growth is highly scalable because it doesn't rely on manual, resource-intensive processes to acquire and retain users.
Customer-Led Feedback Loop: The company actively listens to customer feedback and incorporates it into the product development process.
Examples of product-led companies include Dropbox, Slack, Zoom, Canva, and many other software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies that have successfully implemented a product-led growth strategy.

** THOUGHTS:**
What makes a good product team
10 major misconceptions
You need to solve a problem nobody has solved before
You need to spend as much time as possible understanding “the problem space” … “The primary thing any tech start-up should do is be 10x better than the current prevailing was of doing that thing” - Ben Horowitz.. make sure you are creating a solution for a problem people actually have
You need to be an expert in the domain “True domain expertise is domain knowledge minus domain dogma(religion)” - Shreyas Doshi
You need to listen to your customers “No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime Membership program “ - Jeff Bezos
You need to commit to your solution and iterate until success.. “Fall in love with the problem,
Not the solution “ - Kaaren Hanson..
You need product owners - is a role in a delivery process .. “ a product owner is simply a role in a delivery process. A product manager is responsible for a products value and viability “-Marty Cagan
You need to come up with innovative product ideas “ The disease of thinking that an idea is 90% of the work” -Steve Jobs focuses on moulding the idea into a solution
You need your engineers to focus on coding “ We don’t hire all these engineers to tell them what to do; we hire them to show us what’s possible”-Steve Jobs
You need to focus on creating a product your customers love “One of the biggest mistakes I see companies make is not thinking about both the product and market side of product/market fit “-Martina Lauchengco
You need to process people to grow your company.  Be a day 1 company (care about the customer and product ). “The problem is that at a lot of big companies, the process becomes a substitute for thinking “-Elon Musk 

Transforming to a product-led company
Changing how you build - release no less than once every two weeks. Frequent small releases
Changing how you solve problems - gives the product team problems to solve and not things to build
Changing how you decide which problems to solve
