### DAY 26: OCTOBER 3, TUESDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:

Understanding SQL is fundamental not just for developers, but also for many other roles in tech and business sectors.
I urge you all to make notes and help each other as we go through SQL Bolt.
After SQL Bolt, exciting activities await. We've got a murder mystery game to solve using SQL, 
followed by a challenging exercise on Joins and Sub-queries for those seeking an extra challenge.
Remember, grasping the basics well now is crucial for tackling more complex problems later. 
Let's support each other, share our learnings, and make the most of this journey together.

Before you tackle the murder mystery, I'd recommend going through the walkthrough first: https://mystery.knightlab.com/walkthrough.html

If you're looking for a different explanation on SQL Joins apart from what's provided in SQL Bolt, 
the videos below that might help. They explain Joins in another way that might resonate with you.
