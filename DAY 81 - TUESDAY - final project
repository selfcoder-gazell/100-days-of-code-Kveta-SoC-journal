### DAY 81: DECEMBER 12, TUESDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today we continued on the calendar, finishing the styling touches.
Nadeem came to our room in the morning. 
He gave us advice to polish off our app, do not start new features, till MVP is finished. 
Write README in the git hub repository. 
Testing.
The list of stuff we shall work on is detailed below:

MORNING:


** THOUGHTS:**
My thoughts about this team are not as good vibes as from my previous mid-term project. 
We have a couple of members of our team who are being left behind. 
Myself and Jack Yelland. 
It is our responsibility (as a team) not to leave anyone behind even if they wish to do so. 
Cliche saying but our team is as strongest as it's weakest link.
