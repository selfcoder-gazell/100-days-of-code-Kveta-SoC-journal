### DAY 54: NOVEMBER 5, MONDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today we were introduced to React. 
Our homework for the weekend was: 

Here’s your prep list that’ll be super helpful when we tackle React:
1:Template Literals - Use backticks to create dynamic strings with ease.
2:Destructuring - Unpack properties from objects and elements from arrays into distinct variables.
3:Rest & Spread Operators - Handle multiple parameters gracefully in functions (rest) and clone or merge arrays/objects seamlessly (spread).
4:Ternary Operator - Simplify your if-else statements into one-liners for cleaner code.
5:Logical Operators - Employ && and || for more concise and readable conditional expressions.
6:Short-Circuit Evaluation - Use logical operators to assign values or control flow without full conditional statements.
7:Optional Chaining (?.) - Access properties of nested objects without worrying about null or undefined.
8:Arrow Functions - Write shorter function syntax for better readability and scope management.
9:Modern Array Methods - Get hands-on with .map(), .filter(), .with(), and more for powerful data handling.
10:Immutable Array Patterns - Learn the importance of not altering the original array and techniques to keep your data unmutated.
11:Asynchronous JavaScript - Get to grips with Promises and Async/Await for managing asynchronous operations.
The key is to familiarize, not memorize. :brain: Your goal is to understand how these work and why they're useful.
