### DAY 54: NOVEMBER 5, MONDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today we were introduced to React. 
Our homework for the weekend was: 

Here’s your prep list that’ll be super helpful when we tackle React:
1:Template Literals - Use backticks to create dynamic strings with ease.
2:Destructuring - Unpack properties from objects and elements from arrays into distinct variables.
3:Rest & Spread Operators - Handle multiple parameters gracefully in functions (rest) and clone or merge arrays/objects seamlessly (spread).
4:Ternary Operator - Simplify your if-else statements into one-liners for cleaner code.
5:Logical Operators - Employ && and || for more concise and readable conditional expressions.
6:Short-Circuit Evaluation - Use logical operators to assign values or control flow without full conditional statements.
7:Optional Chaining (?.) - Access properties of nested objects without worrying about null or undefined.
8:Arrow Functions - Write shorter function syntax for better readability and scope management.
9:Modern Array Methods - Get hands-on with .map(), .filter(), .with(), and more for powerful data handling.
10:Immutable Array Patterns - Learn the importance of not altering the original array and techniques to keep your data unmutated.
11:Asynchronous JavaScript - Get to grips with Promises and Async/Await for managing asynchronous operations.
The key is to familiarize, not memorize. :brain: Your goal is to understand how these work and why they're useful.

AFTERNOON:
We have been sent a link to a repository:
https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/bc15-w10-d1-workshop-vanilla-js-counter-team24-w10
The link was for writing a code for adding and subtracting functions.

Tools Checklist
Node.js v18 minimum
Prettier (VS Code Extension)
ESLint (VS Code Extension)
React Developer Tools (Chrome Extension) https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools
React App Initialization
Once you've confirmed the installation of the tools, next step is to try and initialize a React application. 
Try both of these tools/methods:
Try using create-react-app for a more traditional setup. 
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started

If you're up for something newer, give Vite a shot. 
https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project

Both of these tools will scaffold a new React project for you. 
Once initialized, you can launch the app and make sure the welcome page loads in your browser.
Let us know in help-dev about any strange installation issues.

** THOUGHTS:**



** LINK TO WORK:
TASK FOR TOMORROW:
Data for our React Flashcard App (Tomorrow)
Your task is to use a quick video and the React docs to create a list of questions and answers that we'll use as content for our flashcard app.
Task Instructions:
Watch the Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2skans2dP4

Note down any points/concepts that stand out to you.
Explore React Documentation: Visit the React official documentation and 
read through the sections. Focus on understanding the core principles and functionalities of React.
Formulate Questions and Answers: Based on the video and documentation, come up with at least 10 questions related to React. 
An answer should accompany each question. These will form the basis of our flashcard app's content.
Assign Unique IDs: To manage our questions and answers effectively in our app, assign a unique ID to each Q&A pair. 
You can use a simple numbering system, UUIDs, or any other unique identifier scheme you're comfortable with.
We will use these Q&A pairs to build our React flashcard app tomorrow, which will help solidify your understanding of React.
Save your question bank in a JSON file on your machine. Example below:
[
  {
    "id": "q1",
    "question": "What is the Virtual DOM in React?",
    "answer": "The Virtual DOM is a programming concept where a virtual representation of the UI is kept in memory and synced with the real DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation."
  },
  ...
]
