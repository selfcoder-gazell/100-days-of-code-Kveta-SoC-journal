** LINK TO WORK:
FOUND THIS LINK ABOUT USING PLAYWRIGHT TESTING IN A SIMILAR TYPE OF PROJECT AS OURS:
Found this blog from someone (not too old from Jan this year so should not be out of date). 
She is using the same as we (next.js, playwright, vercel) so 
I thought it might give us some useful insight.
