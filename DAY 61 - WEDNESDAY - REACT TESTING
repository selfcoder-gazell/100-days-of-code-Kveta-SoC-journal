DAY 61: NOVEMBER 15, WEDNESDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today we talked to an ex-boot camper about her tech journey. It was lovely listening to someone else's experience. 
Camila Brizzi from Motability Operations Ltd. 
She gave us a lot of tips on how to make the most of the time in this bootcamp. 
INCLUDING:
- reflecting on each day - will solidify the knowledge
- complete homework at the end of each day and on Sundays

MORNING:
Today I have learned that testing dependencies are already installed when we create our react app. 
1. We have to import certain tests into our testing files before the testing can commence. 
  //import the stuff that you need from Jest
  //import the component that you are testing
  //import  the stuff from React testing Library

Sometimes we might need to create a const with all the props we might be using: before the test
  const props = {
    name: "testKveta",
    completed: true,
    tickItem: jest.fn(),
    };

2. Secondly we needed to create a test skeleton:
  test ("description", function (){} );

3. Then we render the component. 
  render (<ListItem name="Potatoes" completed={true} />;

4. Lastly we need to identify the component:
const li = screen.getByRole("listitem")
       expect(li.textContent).toBe("testKveta")
    });


We spent some of the morning working on our workshop - react component testing workshop

AFTERNOON:
In the afternoon we worked through the testing workshop.
