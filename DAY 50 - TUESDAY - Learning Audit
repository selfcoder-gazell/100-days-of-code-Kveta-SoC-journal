### DAY 50: OCTOBER 31, TUESDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today we revised SQL Joins using the links given on days 25-30 of this boot camp. 
We revisited those two links:
SQL Joins Explained - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yeOJ0ZMUYw
SQL Join Examples - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh_pvk48jHA

MORNING:
In the morning Chris (the founder of BootCamp) came in and had a speech/update about 
the progress we were making as a team and gave us feedback about last week's project. 

We revise HTTP:

We revise the computational thinking process.

AFTERNOON:
In the afternoon we practise TIMER API. 
We worked again on the clock app we were sent several weeks ago.
We created a new repository and started all over again. 
Here is the link to it:

https://github.com/RobearP/week9-clock.git

//PLAN
//create a function loop (infinite) to move hand every 1 second
//  setInterval time = 1 second (1000)
//  rotate hand clockwise 6degrees each loop (360 / 60 = 6)
//  let timerId = setTimeout(func|code, [delay], [arg1], [arg2], ...)
// hand.style.transform = `rotate(90deg)`; //:mag: HINT: This is an example of how to rotate the hand!
// moveSecondHand();
