### DAY 74: DECEMBER 1, THURSDAY 1, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today our pseudo-stakeholder is coming around 1:30 or later. 
We are going to present to him - what have we done so far. 
Today we only got Tom Pauley to be our coach. 

MORNING:
We were given guidance from Tom on how to do our Sprint presentation. Two links are below with all the guidance. 

This morning we had a talk with an ex-boot camper Stefan Kudev from bootcamp number 6.
His talk was very useful - as always. 
- Stay curious
- don't stay in a box - keep learning
- find out what is your knack (design, database, security auth). 
- explore and discover tech events
