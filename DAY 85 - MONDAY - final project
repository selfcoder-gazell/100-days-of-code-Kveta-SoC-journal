### DAY 85, DECEMBER 18 MONDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today we had our pseudo-stake-holder at 13:30. We showed him our project and this was his feedback:
- using the love heart to make tips and tricks as favorite 
- profile picture in circle change
- adding tip page - make a slight difference to the design - it is over-crowded
- Growing Calendar is too overcrowded - styling too cramped up - if someone put 20 items planted in one day
- unit tests more valuable than an E2E
- Casper suggested that the buttons be in line not below each other

MORNING:
This morning we decided to work on finishing of pseudo-code for all of our files. 
Testing using playwright for E2E (end-to-end) testing. 
Testing using JestTest. 
Unit testing.
CSS media queries - to styling for responsiveness. 

** THOUGHTS:**
I joined the group doing the E2E to learned more about it. 


Today I had my mentor meeting after two weeks of not being able to due to my mentor's illness. 
We talked about our final project and my C.V. 
The advice to take away was to do something in our last project which I shall be able to use on my C.V. project details. 
I am not sure what to do as we have already done/completed most of the features and just doing the finishing touches this week.
