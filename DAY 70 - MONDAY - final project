### DAY 70: NOVEMBER 27, MONDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today I was an hour late for our team meeting. 
We were given the decision by SoC - on which project we shall be working on. 
The choice was either going to be one of our projects or one of the given by potential customers to solve their problem (choice of 7). 
We were given the GO for one of our projects so we immediately started planning. 
- checked our manifesto - and agreed that it was good enough
- agreed that we were going to create the app we dot voted on last week - vegetable HUB
- created a survey form for our potential users
- prepared for an interview with some of our fellow boot campers
- analyze the result of our survey and interview - Use the result it for decision-making for our future planning
(for our features and what the app should be like, what our targeted users are going to be like etc. )
- discussed what our app should have as features
- created two personas 

MORNING:
Received a message from the SoC:
The project idea youâ€™ve been assigned is: Food/Vegetable Waste App (Submitted Idea)
We can't wait to see how you explore and develop this concept. Remember, 
the joy is in the journey of further exploring the problem and finding innovative solutions.
While we have tried our best to align these projects with your preferences, 
it's important to remember that the idea itself is often one of the least 
important aspects of these projects. What truly matters is how you, as a team, 
commit to it, collaborate, and bring it to life. The skills you develop, the teamwork 
you demonstrate, and the creativity you bring to the table are what will make your project shine.
Have fun and let's make this an amazing experience for everyone involved!
