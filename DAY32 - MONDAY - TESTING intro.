### DAY 31: OCTOBER 9, MONDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Here’s the classroom link: https://classroom.github.com/a/shTyJjCA
You have 15 minutes as a group to:
Initialise a Node.js project (npm init -y)
Use https://vitest.dev/guide/#getting-started to install Vitest as a dev dependency
Use https://vitest.dev/guide/#command-line-interface to run your tests using Vitest
At this stage, you’ll likely see a message in the terminal saying “No test files found”
Create a file named index.test.js
Run your tests again using Vitest
At this stage, you’ll likely see a message in the terminal saying “No test suite found in file”
Use https://vitest.dev/guide/#writing-tests to:
Import the test function from the Vitest package
Create a test (by calling the test function) and give it the bare minimum (a test name and an empty callback function) to register a passing test.
Run your test again using Vitest
At this stage you should see the test pass in the terminal
