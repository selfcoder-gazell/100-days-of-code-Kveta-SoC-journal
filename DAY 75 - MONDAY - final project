### DAY 75: DECEMBER 4, MONDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
This morning we did a retro of our last week - planning. 
We are all very happy with the progress we have made and what we achieved. 

MORNING:
Today we plan to start our repo and install all dependencies, our project is going to be in next.js, using supabase, chakra, and typescript. 
This morning we were learning and practicing how to do git branching correctly so we never need to commit to the main branch. 
We created a dev. branch and then separate each task into another sub-branch. 
In total, we have a few branches to work on (calendar, LogiIn, Tips and Tricks, and superbase). 

** THOUGHTS:**
This branching was tricky to start with but then we realized that it makes our life much easier.
