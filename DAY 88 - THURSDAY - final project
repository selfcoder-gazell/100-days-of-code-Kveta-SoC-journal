### DAY 88, DECEMBER 21, THURSDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today we deployed for the last time and sent a feedback form to our fellow bootcampers for a review of our App. 
Unfortunately, we only got two feedbacks so far. 
We also finished some design issues and media queries to make our app accessible on different types/sizes of devices. 

MORNING:
Stand up in the morning. 

AFTERNOON:
We are planning how to tackle the presentation needed for our stakeholders and deciding who is doing/saying what.
Jack has partially finished our presentation and the link to it is below. Jack also included a script for us to read as we go through the PRESENTATION. 


** THOUGHTS:**
Our 4 week project is coming to an end which is quite sad.
