### DAY 15: SEPTEMBER 22, FRIDAY, 2023 (HACKATHLON - W3 - TEAM 31 - )

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today we had a visitor from BOOTCAMP 2 called Manu Magalhees. 
Here are some tips from her:
- pace yourself
- after dinner  STOP
- enjoy weekends
- Learn from each other
- perseverance is key
- any job is easier than this boot camp 

Today was our HACKHATLHLON Friday. We were given a task to code a weather app.
Weather App Hackathon
Brief
Welcome to the Weather App Hackathon! Over the past week, you've been diving deeper into JavaScript, learning about the DOM, 
APIs, and how to make API calls using fetch. It's time to apply what you've learned. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, 
is to plan, develop, and present a fully functioning weather app in a single day.

** THOUGHTS:**

This was a challenge (as HACKHATLHLONS always are). With my lovely teammates (Alex/Paul and Luiz) we managed to create an MVP that was functioning as intended with little extra.
This week I realised the importance of communication - is more than the knowledge of coding.
