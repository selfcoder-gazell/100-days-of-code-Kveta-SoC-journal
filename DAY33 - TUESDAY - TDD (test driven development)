### DAY 31: OCTOBER 10, TUESDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Test-driven development (TDD)
Test-driven development means writing tests first, before writing code. The tests define what the code should do. 
Then you write code to pass the tests. Writing tests first helps you think through what the code needs to do. 
It also helps ensure the code stays organized and is easy to change later. 
We'll use Vitest to write and run tests easily.

ðŸ’¡ OBJECTIVES FOR THE WORKSHOP
This workshop is all about TDD! Here's a glimpse of what you'll be achieving by the end of this workshop:

Object 1: Write software using a TDD approach
Object 2: Applying the TDD cycle (red -> green -> refactor)
Object 3: Having a disciplined focus on writing the simplest, minimal working implementation to pass a failing test

If you want to use test.each, this video might be a good starting point:

The video covers Jest (not Vitest), but the concepts and approach should be very similar.
