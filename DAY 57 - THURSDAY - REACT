### DAY 57: NOVEMBER 9, THURSDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:

Here are a few stretch goal ideas for the React Flashcards app:
When there are no flashcards, show a message to the user like "You haven't added any flashcards yet! 
Start creating your learning set."
Above the footer, we can display a count of how many flashcards have been added. Something like 
"You have added [x] flashcards" would be great. (Adding derived state)
Add functionality that allows the user to change/edit the question and answer on any card.
Allow the user to add a category to each flashcard (difficulty or subject) and then implement 
sorting or filtering options.
Remember, these are stretch goals, so let's focus on getting our core functionality perfect first and then 
tackle these as we can. Also, feel free to come up with your own and improve the app as you see fit. (
