### DAY 46: OCTOBER 25, WEDNESDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:

Today we continued our mid-term project. We split into teams of two. Two teams were working on 
the back end while one was working on the front end. We remained in the 
same team throughout the day but we swapped from back to front etc. 
We completed the back end quicker than expected so in the afternoon we all worked on different parts of the front end.
One team was working on the footer while the other team worked on the main part of our app/page. 
We also wrote some tests to test the code we wrote ( tests we wrote included POST, GET, and DELETE - some of the CRUD functions). 
While working in pairs, one person wrote the code while the other person was leading/typing. 
We were using the Milestones we set in the GIT HUB yesterday to monitor our progress. 

Throughout the day we were continuously collaborating - visiting each other's mini-teams 
(rooms) and reassuring that we were on the track and asking if anyone needed help. 

WE also came across some issues along the way. One of the main issues was merging our branches. 
Which we solve together as a team.
