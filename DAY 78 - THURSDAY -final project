Message from Tom on Slack:
Hello Team, I hope the day is going well and you’re remembering to take breaks.
I’ll drop a link below to a set of example Sprint Demo slides for how to structure the next 2 demos. You will notice:
A reminder of the problem being solved.
Sprint Goal (Status, Done/Not-done)
If you’ve missed the goal, say how much by and what you plan to do very briefly (cut scope etc)
Repeat the next step for each Epic you’ve worked on this Sprint:
Overview of the Epic (title, description, status, indicator of progress of underlying User Stories).
Then cover each User Story (title, description, status, and then demo the work).
Repeat for each User Story …
Hopefully, you can see the value of this format. It’s about starting high level and giving a status indicator,  then drilling down. This is the repeated pattern that gives people context then detail.
