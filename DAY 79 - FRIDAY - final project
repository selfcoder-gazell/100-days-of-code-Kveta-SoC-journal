### DAY 79: DECEMBER 8, FRIDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Todays STANDUP:

We plan today:
- Get supabase working
- Log-in holds data
- Adding tips and tricks data to the database
- Finish tips and tricks pop-ups
- blockers - superbase get it working


MORNING:
Talk from: Kendall M. - ex-boot camper cohort before us
- Kendall used to be a vicar
- It is not about coding - it's about how you solve problems
- Tech Interview tips:
    - Talk through your thinking process while you are solving a problem using a code or not
    - it is not just about getting to a solution 
    - it is about showing your thinking process - your problem-solving skills
    - breaking down a problem to the minimalistic problems possible
    - show them that you know how to learn

When you get a new ticket:
- take time to understand it for the first 10-15 minutes
- search engines will help you
- Show what you found and do not be afraid to ask questions (is this right)
- Show what have you tried

Recruitment hackathon tips:
- analyze who is on your team
- how do you perform within a team
- Stakeholders want to know about the whole problem (user stories and presentations are more important than the code).
- Show how you contributed to the team. 
- make sure your voice is heard

SoC helped in this way:
- how to work in a team
- sprints, scrams, standups, git branching, pulling, skills valuable
- resolve conflict - skills


** THOUGHTS:**
Beneficial talk by one of us ex-boot camper Kendall. 

AFTERNOON: 
TALK FROM NADEEM my favorite: 
- have we achieved our sprint goal
- set expectations for next week today
- evidence of reflective practice (retrospective not just stand ups), can use 4 L - what we like, do not like, what shall we improve, what shall we do differently)
- criticize our own progress
- the ability to criticize our achievements
- not being able to do that is a problem
- record the output of that
- can we see an improvement
- process-related
-
Nadeem offered to check our CV if we wanted to. and give us a piece of advice individually for interviews, 
INTERVIEW TIPS:
We should make sure that everyone is equally heard, when was the last mistake made?
Job is a triangle (me, business company values, technology used in a company).
Ask shit lots of questions. 

Casper input today:
Only 1 h1
Homepage logo looks like a button and is confusing that it’s not a button
In Calendar labels also look like buttons
Noise on add form and input fields also looks like a button
Logo in the header?
Underscores in some veg names
How much value does having a bio in the user section?
The recipe bot is a bit of a gimmick
Tracking calendar is a nice idea
The header is not a header - it’s a div
Spin up a new app to test supabase - divide and conquer
Chrome dev tools in vs code - run and debug
