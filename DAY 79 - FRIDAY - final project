MORNING:
Talk from: Kendall M. - ex-boot camper cohort before us
- Kendall used to be a vicar
- It is not about coding - it's about how you solve problems
- Tech Interview tips:
    - Talk through your thinking process while you are solving a problem using a code or not
    - it is not just about getting to a solution 
    - it is about showing your thinking process - your problem-solving skills
    - breaking down a problem to the minimalistic problems possible
    - show them that you know how to learn

When you get a new ticket:
- take time to understand it for the first 10-15 minutes
- search engines will help you
- Show what you found and do not be afraid to ask questions (is this right)
- Show what have you tried

Recruitment hackathon tips:
- analyze who is on your team
- how do you perform within a team
- Stakeholders want to know about the whole problem (user stories and presentations are more important than the code).
- Show how you contributed to the team. 
- make sure your voice is heard

SoC helped in this way:
- how to work in a team
- sprints, scrams, standups, git branching, pulling, skills valuable
- resolve conflict - skills
