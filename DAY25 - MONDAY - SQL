### DAY 25: OCTOBER 2, MONDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
 Today we got introduced to SQL - Databases and practiced SQL Querry syntax. 

MORNING:

AFTERNOON:


** THOUGHTS:**
SQL as a language seems easier to start with (compared with JavaScript) but soon 
gets equally challenging as we go deeper into the more advanced syntax - Selecting, updating, deleting, etc. data within a database table.
