### DAY 60: NOVEMBER 14, TUESDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:

Today we were talking about custom hooks in REACT and how to use them. 
We also talk about PROPs drilling.
Only descendant components can use the value. 

CONTEXT can solve the problem of PROPs drilling. 
1. passes data deeply (same as props drilling)
2. Provide context
3. Use context
