### DAY 62: NOVEMBER, FRIDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today our journey continued. 
We started to work on our app. 

MORNING:
We had another ex-boot camper giving us a motivational speech this morning. Mohamed Mohamud. 

** THOUGHTS:**
Today was very hard. Learning a new concept ourselves - without any guidance. It was different but something we need to master to succeed in our future roles as software developers.
