### DAY 80: DECEMBER, MONDAY 11, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today it was only three of us in a team (Patryk, myself, and Jack). The remaining three were at a tech event. 
Because it was only three of us tackled small issues - mainly the ones that were mentioned by our pseudo-stakeholder Casper. 
Styling a few buttons, restyling the header, and making the Adding Tips and Tricks page not so busy. 


MORNING:
In the morning we had a visitor - to ask us about our project. 

AFTERNOON:
We deployed once only today - as not many changes were made.

To add days to a date in JavaScript, you can use the Date object's setDate method. 
This method sets the day of the Date object relative to the beginning of the currently set month.
Here's how you can modify your code to add 2 days to the start date:
let date = new Date(); // Assuming this is your start date
let newDate = new Date(date); // Create a new Date object to avoid mutating the original date
newDate.setDate(date.getDate() + 2); // Add 2 days to the date
setEvent((curr) => {
  return [
    ...curr,
    {
      title: data.target[0].value,
      start: date,
      allDay: true,
      display: 'block',
      backgroundColor: '#F3EBE4',
      textColor: '#47594E',
      borderColor: '#F3EBE4',
      eventOverlap: true
    },
    {
      title: data.target[0].value + "second",
      start: newDate, // Use the new date here
      allDay: true,
      display: 'block',
      backgroundColor: '#F3EBE4',
      textColor: '#47594E',
      borderColor: '#F3EBE4',
      eventOverlap: true
    }
  ];
});
In this code, new Date(date) creates a new Date object with the same date as date, 
and newDate.setDate(date.getDate() + 2) adds 2 days to newDate. 
This way, you're not mutating the original date object, 
and newDate is a date 2 days after date.
