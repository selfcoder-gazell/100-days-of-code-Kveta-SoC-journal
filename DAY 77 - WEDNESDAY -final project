MORNING:
We have had a very productive day. 
Link to our app:
https://harvest-hub-tau.vercel.app/

** THOUGHTS:**
Today we progressed very well - we working in an agile way. 
Deployed twice today - each time as a team. 
Used git branching and committed all changes together. 

** LINK TO WORK:
TIPS from Livi - use the Procreate App on an iPad to create images. 
Use Cloudinary - to store images online as a database. 

WHAT I LEARN TODAY:
I learned to use two div elements on top of each other. One with the opacity to make it see-through. 
One with position relative and one with position absolute. 
CODE FOR ABOVE:
<Link href="./Calendar">
          <div
            className="link-container"
            style={{
              position: "relative",
              backgroundColor: "#b9a48c",
              color: "#f3ebe4",
            }}
          >
            <img
              src="/assets/CalendarBackground.png"
              style={{ width: "16rem", height: "auto", opacity: "0.25" }}
            ></img>
            <h1 style={{ position: "absolute" }}>Growing Calendar</h1>
          </div>
        </Link>
