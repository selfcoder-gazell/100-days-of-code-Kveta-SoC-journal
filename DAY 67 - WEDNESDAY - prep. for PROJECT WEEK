Today we were introduced to our BIG PROJECT team for the next four weeks. 
We were given tasks:
- get to know each other
- create a team manifesto
- talk about and generate three ideas for our future app


Remote Creative Session
Remote Brainstorming Instructions

Objective: To brainstorm and refine project ideas using Jamboard and the Disney Ideation Methodology, culminating in 3 detailed project concepts.
Tools Needed: Google Jamboard, time-keeping device, a Team Manifesto with agreement on how to make decisions, and an open mind!
Preparation: Before starting the session, ensure all team members have access to the Jamboard link. Familiarise yourself with the Disney Ideation Methodology phases: Dreamer, Realist, and Critic. Have your agreed team manifesto ready.

Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Warm-Up Activity (5 minutes): 

    * Return from your creativity-enhancing walk.
    * Open your team’s Jamboard.
    * Read these instructions and briefly discuss the session's goal: generating and refining project ideas. Make sure everyone’s on the same page.

1. Idea Generation (5 minutes): 

    * Set a timer for 5 minutes.
    * Each team member independently writes down their ideas on virtual post-its in Jamboard. Remember, no idea is too big or small!
    * Focus on a problem, with a customer / organisation in mind that can benefit from it.
    * The hard part - let your ideas go. Once you’ve written it, they belong to the universe and so try to be self-aware about your attachment to ideas and embrace everything on the board equally.

1. Dreamer Phase (10-15 minutes): 

    * Once the timer ends, collectively review all ideas.
    * Discuss ideas as a team. Encourage each member to ask questions and build upon others' ideas. This may have to be limited to a certain number of ideas per person, so you’d choose the top 1 or 2 you came up with so that you can stick to time.
    * Maintain a positive, open environment where creativity flourishes.

1. Voting (5 minutes): 

    * You decided how to make decisions - now decide as a team
    * You’ll likely have a voting system like dot or Roman voting - at this stage you’ll take 3-5 ideas through so you can delve deeper into them in the next phases

1. Realist Phase (10-15 minutes): 

    * Focus on the selected ideas and discuss how they can be realistically implemented.
    * Assign one idea to each group member (or small groups if the team is large) to develop a brief paragraph detailing the problem and potential direction (avoiding specific solutions for now).

1. Critic Phase (10-15 minutes): 

    * Review each developed idea.
    * Critically assess the feasibility, potential challenges, and practicality of each idea.
    * Offer constructive feedback and make refinements as necessary.

1. Conclusion and Next Steps (5 minutes): 

    * Finalise the top 3 ideas, ensuring each has a clear problem statement and direction.
    * These do not have to be fully formed or thought out, they are there to describe a generally interesting problem, audience, and direction.

Tips for an Effective Session:

* Encourage open communication and active participation from all team members.
* Avoid criticism during the Dreamer phase to keep the creative flow.
* Keep an eye on the time to ensure all phases are adequately covered.
* Use the Critic phase constructively to refine ideas rather than dismiss them.

Remember, the goal is to end with 3 agreed potential problem ideas / directions that your team is excited to explore further!
