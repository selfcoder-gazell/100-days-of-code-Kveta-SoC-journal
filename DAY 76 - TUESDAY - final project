### DAY 76: DECEMBER 5, TUESDAY 5, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today we did morning STAND-UP, a retrospective of yesterday's work - achievements. 
code for branching in VSC:
git flow feature start feature_branch
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature_branch

MORNING:
We spent the morning trying to deploy our code. We kept having issues but resolved them in the end. 
We practice merging all our code into the develop branch (from the little branches we work on in pairs) and then into the main. 
There were some issues on the way. 

AFTERNOON:
We divided ourselves into groups of twos and started working on our code by lunchtime.

** THOUGHTS:**
WE did a retrospective at the end of the day and were very happy with our progress. 
The plan for tomorrow morning is to try to deploy our new code again.
