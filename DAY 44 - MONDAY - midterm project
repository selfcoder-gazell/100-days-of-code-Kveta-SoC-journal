### DAY 44: OCTOBER 23, MONDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today we started working on our mid-term project (see below for details). We were put in a team of six (Alex, David, Faizan, Patryk, Siyun). 


Today :
1. practice 10 seconds intro
2. deciding on our team Manifesto
3. chosen our team name - SINISTER SEVEN (our team number was seven) and including my dog it was 7 in our team
4. brainstorming first
5. narrow down the brainstorm to a set of questions for our questionnaire for 
research among us boot campers to find out which idea would be most beneficial for us 
6. We analyze the survey results and make a decision based on the doting system we decided to 
go for an app to give us alerts/reminders as to what we should revise and when. 
7. Then we created two personas (Samantha and Simon). 
8. We then used the (dreamer, realist, critic) Dysney approach to make further 
decisions about what our app should do - features it should have, etc. 
9. 


THE PROBLEM WE ARE SOLVING HERE IS BOOT CAMPERS NOT BEING ABLE TO RETAIN INFORMATION DUE TO THE LUCK OF SPACED REPETITION. 


THE PRODUCT IS:
A mobile app that will allow users to add topics to study which can be added to a list 
which will set reminders for the user to revise based on spaced repetition

TODAYS'S PROJECT:
Week 8 Project Guidelines

The Application (Deliverable 1)

We want to see a full-stack application you’ve designed and built to solve a problem - we’d 
like this to include a front-end application (HTML, CSS, JS) that calls out to a backend application 
(Node.js). Your front end should send data to or fetch data from the backend in order to perform its function. 
The application should have some tests.

The Presentation/Demo (Deliverable 2)

We want to see you present/demo your work. The presentation/demo will cover your process 
(UX process through to build) and the working application itself.

We will give you a specific presentation guide that tells you exactly what you should cover, 
it will also give you an idea of the demo order (problem first, then solution, then process).

Tip: practice makes perfect, record yourselves doing it and time it. Then review the recording, 
make changes, and repeat until it’s smooth. Watch some previous presentations for inspiration.

Approaching the Project
--------------------------------
Problem / Ideation / Planning (in that order!)

Do not go straight to talking about ideas you could build. Resist the urge. 
Instead, start by empathizing with the user and their problems (Bootcamp). 
Sit down as a group and brainstorm problems you’ve experienced.
Then dot vote on which problem to choose as your focus.
Then move on to Disney Ideation to work through possible solutions.
The problem should be solved before you start coding. Use day 1 to work out 
who you are solving the problem for, what the problem is, what solution you will pursue, and plan your work.
Tools you could use:
FigJam
Mural
Miro

-----------------
Design Time (Inspiration & Tools)

Come up with a design/brand that is unique. There are lots of tools to help you do this quite quickly.
Tools and inspiration:
https://www.awwwards.com/
Awards - A great site showing high-quality websites/apps

https://coolors.co/
Coolors - Generate color palette ideas.

https://www.midjourney.com/
Midjourney - AI prompt to turn your ideas into fresh takes (take inspiration from sources mentioned above). 
There are lots of other AI tools for brand and design generation.
------------------------
Planning

Plan your MVP. Create a list of features and functionality you’d like to build to solve the user's problem. 
Then prioritise and limit scope to make the build achievable - you only have 2 days to build this. You can 
always plan an extra feature as a “stretch goal”.
Create User Stories that describe each top-level feature from a User’s point of view. Here’s a great article 
on writing good User Stories 
https://medium.com/@george_wilde/a-guide-to-writing-effective-user-stories-658823dec2e0


Take those User Stories and create Tasks under them. Think about what is needed for the front end and back 
end for that feature (User Story) to work - these are your tasks.
Use Trello or some other project management board software to write up User Stories and Tasks.

-------------------------------
General Tips

Focus on getting one whole feature complete before moving to the next. Do not fall into the temptation 
of having lots of open work tickets - focus on completeness. A key thing in Agile is limiting “Work In Progress”. 
It’s better to have one feature completed well rather than two or three half done.
Communication is key
Keeping in sync with each other is vital; stand-ups are a great way to do this. 
There is no limit on when stand-ups should be, that's down to you as a team... many 
teams do a couple a day to check in quickly with each other.
Being clear about who is doing what is helpful when working across a team.
As you build and progress through your tickets, keep checking the plan and keeping it up 
to date so everyone stays on the same page throughout.
