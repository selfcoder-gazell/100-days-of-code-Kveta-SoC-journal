### DAY 17: SEPTEMBER 24, SUNDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Scheduling: setTimeout and setInterval

We may decide to execute a function not right now, but at a certain time later. That’s called “scheduling a call”.

There are two methods for it:

setTimeout allows us to run a function once after the interval of time.
setInterval allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, and then repeating continuously at that interval.
These methods are not a part of JavaScript specification. But most environments have an internal scheduler and provide these methods. In particular, they are supported in all browsers and Node.js.

THE SYNTAX:
Set Timeout:
let timerId = setTimeout(func|code, [delay], [arg1], [arg2], ...)
-------------------------------
function sayHi(phrase, who) {
  alert( phrase + ', ' + who );
}
------------------------------------
setTimeout(sayHi, 1000, "Hello", "John"); // Hello, John
---------------------------------
Canceling with clearTimeout
setInterval
Nested setTimeout
Zero delay setTimeout

** THOUGHTS:**
It is very useful to have a timer on a function.
