### DAY 82: DECEMBER 13, WEDNESDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
Today we had another talk from a lady from Methods.
Katja Alcock | LinkedIn
She was talking mainly about accessibility and gave us a few web links to explore on this subject. 

MORNING:
The rest of the morning we were deciding who was doing what - PLANNING THE DAY.
Teams decided to use a wheel and we started working on polishing off little bits. 
I was teamed up with Sean, James with Jack, and Patryk with Livi. 

QUESTIONS TO ASK CASPER:
- title for tips and tricks - is it good or not - shall we change it
- title for Growing calendar - shall we leave it or change it to just Calendar 
- Header - it is not sticky at the moment but shall we make it sticky?
- How about the icon with Veggies on the main page - shall we use it? does it still look like a button?
- What does he think about using icons (for the home and for the user button) perhaps?
