# Team 7
“If they could provide a slide to introduce the problem, as my colleague and I felt lost when they were introducing the problem verbally”
---
“Great idea for a psychological app to aid learning. Very clear problem space definition and product definition. 
It looked like the boot campers brought all of their collective previous work experience to boost the ideas! Which was great!
Great voting ideas and use of team allocation, but this could've been brought to life in their manifesto. Use of [gartic. io](http://gartic.io/) was a great team idea.”
---
“Demo was a little short and did not show off much of the app, would have liked to see more!”
