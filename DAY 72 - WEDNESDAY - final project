### DAY 72: NOVEMBER 29, WEDNESDAY, 2023 ()
Today we have a guest talk from Methods - Elizabeth: 9:30 to 10:30.
We will be talking about user-centered design. 
The most take takeaway from this talk is the importance of the discovery phase of a project design. 
Sometimes you have to go back to the drawing board back to the discovery phase and not move into the Alpha phase till ready. 

Discovery: Created personas based on the discovery process. 
Needs to be right for the user - don't move forward unless it is right. 

Alpha: Prototyping in alpha. What are we going to test and see if it works or not. 
Usability testing. Might go back to Discovery if I needed to. 

Beta: 

Live: Launching 

Research can be quite personal. How to deal with it. As a researcher, 
you will have to ask some difficult questions. 
You need to be forward - so they know what they are going to be asked. 
A researcher needs to be as prepared as possible. 
I could always end the interview if want to. 
Should offer follow-up support.
Produce an information sheet and consent form before the research - interview. 
Sometimes we do not need personas - lots of different ways of communicating who our users are.
