### DAY 72: NOVEMBER 29, WEDNESDAY, 2023 ()
Today we have a guest talk from Methods - Elizabeth: 9:30 to 10:30.
We will be talking about user-centered design. 
The most take takeaway from this talk is the importance of the discovery phase of a project design. 
Sometimes you have to go back to the drawing board back to the discovery phase and not move into the Alpha phase till ready. 

Discovery: Created personas based on the discovery process. 
Needs to be right for the user - don't move forward unless it is right. 

Alpha: Prototyping in alpha. What are we going to test and see if it works or not? 
Usability testing. Might go back to Discovery if I needed to. 

Beta: 

Live: Launching 

Research can be quite personal. How to deal with it. As a researcher, 
you will have to ask some difficult questions. 
You need to be forward - so they know what they are going to be asked. 
A researcher needs to be as prepared as possible. 
I could always end the interview if want to. 
Should offer follow-up support.
Produce an information sheet and consent form before the research - interview. 
Sometimes we do not need personas - lots of different ways of communicating who our users are. 

MORNING:
STAND-UP today:
1. we talked about MVP from yesterday if we all agree on it or not. 
There were some adjustments done yesterday and we all agreed. 
2. The plan for today is:
  - to finalize our MVP 
  - to start wireframing ( both versions - low and high fidelity) 

Today we decided that another survey would be beneficial. 
Sent out another one to Bootcampers as well as a Facebook gardening webpage and waiting for the results. 
We changed the wording and added different questions  to our survey. 
The theme of our app is changing from predominantly buy/sell to swap/share/learn about gardening blogs. 

AFTERNOON: 
STAND-UP afternoon: 
We started working on our wireframing and talked about the color scheme. 
We searched and found similar websites for inspiration as well as apps.  
We are trying to make the app friendly for the older generation - who are not as good at technology (big letters - easily readable etc.)



** THOUGHTS:**
Nadeem came to our room today and gave us advice on how to tackle this project. 
- We should decide on an artificial cut of date. 
- we only have 2-2.5 weeks to complete this in reality
- we should make sure to create a component tree - hierarchies are a must (parent, child also known as smart and dump). 
- we should master the git hub flow - branching - main. (repo branching, raise pull requests)
- deploy early on
- do not merge to the main from the command line
- conflict should only exist locally - not on the main
- main should be always releasable - employers will ask about that
- The use of particular technology  - why did we use that - employers will ask about that - benefits - to do what? 
- Give credible technical answers to stakeholders
- Let go of ego - agree - disagree - quickly - move forward - move on
- Hardcoded data to start with. 
- can build UX without backend

At the end of week three - what are we showing them? The product looks like it works. 
Individual stories - how did we contribute to the team?
Ask ourselves what is success as a team.
