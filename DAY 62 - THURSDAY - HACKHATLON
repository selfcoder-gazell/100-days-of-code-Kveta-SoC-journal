### DAY 62: NOVEMBER, THURSDAY, 2023 ()

** Today's PROGRESS**:
This morning we talked to Chris - the master of them all from SoC. About QandA. 

MORNING:
Loz talked to us about Roadmaps. There is too much to learn so all I can do is learn a bit more today. 
How could you not get overwhelmed by all of it? 
As a boot camper, this is going to be good for knowing what we do not know. 
We never going to know everything. 
We always going to be chucked stuff we do not know through our career.

Arshi advice: 
Learn things on demand. 
Focus on what is in front of you.
Over time knowledge is accumulative. 

** THOUGHTS:**
Our Hackhathlon is about scoping wisely, collaboration is the key, and handling pressure. 
Prioritize our learning not flashy results.
